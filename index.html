      <h1>Welcome to ImageStack</h1>
      <p>Your reliable partner in AWS infrastructure demos built using the Cloud Development Kit (CDK).</p>
      <p>In today's fast-paced tech industry, showcasing the power and versatility of AWS to your customers is essential. However, setting up infrastructure for every demo can be time-consuming and complex. That's where ImageStack steps in.</p>
      <p>With ImageStack, Solutions Architects can rapidly spin up demos for customers, significantly simplifying the demonstration process. By leveraging our pre-defined AWS infrastructure templates, you can customize and instantiate an AWS environment in no time.

      <p>Beyond that, we offer seamless integration with AWS S3 for image storage demonstrations. This feature allows you to easily simulate real-world application scenarios, displaying the efficiency, scalability, and security of AWS services to your customers. During the demo, you can upload images swiftly, with real-time feedback provided during the upload process.</p>
      <p>Time is of the essence, and with ImageStack, you spend less time configuring and more time demonstrating the potential of AWS. Join us and expedite your AWS demo setup with the power of ImageStack.</p>
